# PascalCompiler
A compiler written in Java for a Pascal-like programming language.

In order to test the compiler, download the code and run the main function in ```Parser.java```.

Inside the main function in ```Parser.java```, the pathname parameter in the first line of code refers to the input file with Pascal-like code.
The outputFileName parameter in the third line of code refers to the output file that will be in assembly code. 
You can edit these file names as you like.

After running the main function in ```Parser.java```, the output file can then be run in MARS or QTSPIM to test the validity of the compiler.
