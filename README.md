# PascalCompiler
A compiler written in Java for a Pascal-like programming language.

In order to test the compiler, download the code and run the main function in ```Parser.java```.

The pathname in the first line of code is the file with Pascal-like code.
The outputFileName in the third line of code is the output file that will be in assembly code. 
You can edit these file names as you like.

The output file can then be run in MARS or QTSPIM to test the validity of the compiler.
